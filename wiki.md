# Journey Open Narrative System

Hello,

We are about to go on an epic Journey. Relax, keep an open mind and remember to have fun along the way.

Let's do this.

## What now?

First you'll need to learn the game.

Then you'll need to learn about the world.

Finally we'll build your character.

## Can I help support Journey?
Journey is and always will be free to everyone. However, if you enjoy the system and would like to support its further development, please head over to our Patreon page and join our community. You'll not only get a special role in our discord but you'll get early access to new modules and upcoming campaign content.

## What is this game?

Journey is about creating a story either alone or with other Travelers. Sometimes you'll even have a Guide setting the scene and revealing the world to your group.

The rules will help your group tell their story and determine what happens along the way.

Once you have a character ready, you get to take control and decide what they do, then fate will decide how well it goes.

Journey can create short one session stories or epic tales that span through years of play. In the end though, there's no winning or losing, it was always about the Journey.

## What do I need to know?

Journey is at it's best with 3 Travelers (players) and 1 Guide, but don't let that hold you back, Journey can be played with any combination of Travelers and Guides.

Each Traveler gets to create character that will act as one of the main characters in the story,while the Guide sets up the story and plays as the rest of the world, from NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to enemies and sometimes even the land itself. Their job is help the Travelers visualize and interact with the world. During Guideless play, Travelers will take turns describing and acting as the world around them.

Usually the it is the responsibility of the Guide to determine the cconsequences for the Travelers actions, however during Guidless play, the Traveler taking the action should imagine their own fate, though sometimes their fellow Travelers might offer suggestions and that's always great.

The Guide and the Travelers are always working together, collaborating on telling a unique strory, it should never feel like they are playing against each other.

## What do I need?

While Journey is always best played in person it was designed with distance in mind, and playing with friends accross the world is quite common now.

Each Traveler should have a few hours of free time, a way to roll a 10 sided die, and a way to communicate with the rest of the group. Having a piece of paper and a pencil to keep track of mechanics is helpful too. *Character Sheets coming soon.*

## How do I play?
Getting started with a bare bones simple game of journey only requires the [Basics](wiki/basics/index.md)

However, if you want to play the a more involved game of Journey then you'll need the [Advanced](wiki/advanced.md) rules.

## What now?

GO PLAY! Have fun, find some friends and go tell an amazing story. Be sure to check out out upcoming Campaign guides that give your group detailed worlds to play around in!
