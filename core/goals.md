# Goal Tracking System

Goals offer both long and short term direction for Travelers. Achieving goals, nets powerful rewards called "Fate" which is a resource that can be exchanged for many things depending on which modules you're using for play.

## What is a goal?
In Journey a goal is like a mission or quest that a Traveler or group might undertake. Travelers or groups declare goals and then make progress towards completing them over time. Once a goal is completed players earn **Fate** a powerful resource in Journey.

## How do I declare a goal?
It's as easy as letting your party and or Guide know that you have a new goal. If you have room to add one more then you must decide how difficult this goal is going to be to achieve. With the goals module turned on the digitcal character sheet will offer you a place to track your goals.

## How many goals can I have?
Each Traveler can have 9 goals, once declared they can be abandoned at any time. Each party can have a max of 3 party goals tracked by the Guide.

## How difficult are goals to complete?
There are 3 difficulty tiers for goals, Minor, Major & Mythic. Minor goals require 3 progress before they can be achieved, while Major goals require 6 and Mythic goals require 9.

## How do I make progress?
That depends on the story, but your guide will let you know if something you've done counts as progress towards one of your goals and you can always ask your guide if they think an action you want to take will count towards a goal's progress.

## What happens when I achieve my goal?
You are rewarded with Fate, 1, 2 & 3 for Minor, Major and Mythic goals respectively. Depending on the kind of story you are playing it you might find other rewards along the way.

## What kind of goals should I have?
That's depends entirely on your character, but I'll include a few examples to help stir your imagination.
Minor: I will find my keys.
Major: I will join the hockey team.
Mythic:I will find my long lost sister!

## What is Fate?
Fate is a unique mechanic of the Journey system, a resource earned by achieving goals that lets you alter your own Fate during play.

## What can I do with Fate?
Fate can be spent on many things. Some modules may even contain additional uses for Fate.

Some uses require more than one Fate and in these cases Fate can be pooled from more than one Traveler. In the core system Fate can be used for the following things:

- (1) Change your roll to an <8> garunteeing a flat success.
- (3) Alter your character's Aspects any way you like.
- (9) Ressurect a fallen Traveler.
