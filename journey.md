# Journey Open Narrative System

Hello,

We are about to go on an epic Journey. Relax, keep an open mind and remember to have fun along the way.

Let's do this.

## Can I help support Journey?
Journey is and always will be free to everyone. However, if you enjoy the system and would like to support its further development, please head over to our Patreon page and join our community. You'll not only get a special role in our discord but you'll get early access to new modules and upcoming campaign content.

## What is this game?

Journey is about creating a story either alone or with other Travelers. Sometimes you'll even have a Guide setting the scene and revealing the world to your group.

The rules will help your group tell their story and determine what happens along the way.

Once you have a character ready, you get to take control and decide what they do, then fate will decide how well it goes.

Journey can create short one session stories or epic tales that span through years of play. In the end though, there's no winning or losing, it was always about the Journey.

## What do I need to know?

Journey is at it's best with 3 Travelers (players) and 1 Guide, but don't let that hold you back, Journey can be played with any combination of Travelers and Guides.

Each Traveler gets to create character that will act as one of the main characters in the story,while the Guide sets up the story and plays as the rest of the world, from NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to enemies and sometimes even the land itself. Their job is help the Travelers visualize and interact with the world. During Guideless play, Travelers will take turns describing and acting as the world around them.

Usually the it is the responsibility of the Guide to determine the cconsequences for the Travelers actions, however during Guidless play, the Traveler taking the action should imagine their own fate, though sometimes their fellow Travelers might offer suggestions and that's always great.

The Guide and the Travelers are always working together, collaborating on telling a unique strory, it should never feel like they are playing against each other.

## What do I need?

While Journey is always best played in person it was designed with distance in mind, and playing with friends accross the world is quite common now.

Each Travelers should have a few hours of free time, a way to roll a 10 sided die, and a way to communicate with the rest of the group. If you're planing on using any modules outside the core system having a character sheet is also helpful for tracking any additional mechanics of the game.

## How do I play?
You can find the basic rules here: [Journey Core Systems](core/content.md)

## But what about combat?
Combat in the Core of Journey is very minimal, though if you want something more in depth take a look at the [Advanced Combat Module](modules/combat.md)

In Journey Core, combat works like this: on a success your opponent is incapacitated and on a failure you are incapacitated. It's that simple.

If all Travelers are incompacitated the Guide will determine whether or not that means death based on the nature of the conflict.

## Is that it?

Yes, and no. This is everything you need to get started playing with your friends. However, there are more modules available to add more exciting mechanics to the gameplay. You want more in depth combat? Use the Advanced Combat Module. Want to add items? Check out our Inventory Management Module. Want to give your character Stats that can bend fate and add bonuses to your rolls? Utilize our Character Stats Module. Want to give your character special abilities that can further define who they are? Check out our Special Abilities Module! 

Many systems are available in this book and more will be added over time on our website and your group can use as many or as few as you like to create the gaming experience that's most fun for you and your friends.

## What now?

GO PLAY! Have fun, find some friends and go tell an amazing story. Be sure to check out out upcoming Campaign guides that give your group detailed worlds to play around in!
