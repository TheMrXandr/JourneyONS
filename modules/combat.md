# Advanced Combat Module

## So, What Exactly is combat?
In Journey, combat is defined as an agressive encounter where one or more parties take violent action against another. Or put simply, when someone hits someone else. Some games can be played entirely without combat as a mechanic, but considering it's popularity in RPGs I felt it would be missed if Journey didn't offer some form of formal combat mechanics.

## So how does combat work?
Combat is meant to be quick while still offering a depth of strategy for your party. Conducted in quick coordinated efforts called "Clashes", the party has 60 seconds to decide together what they would like to do each clash and then all the Travelers roll at once. Failures and successes are determined and the scene is narrated by the Guide. If any advesaries are still standing another clash insues and this process repeats until either all the advesaries or all the Travelers have been incapacitated.

Take combat seriously in Journey, it is always dangerous and always potentially deadly.

## How much health do I have exactly?
Firstly Journey uses a metric called Harm which represents how what shape you are in, the higher your harm the closer to death or serious injury you come. By default with the Combat module Travelers can withstand 9 harm before loosing consiousness. However, some modules like Special Abilities or Equipment Management, might include features which  mitigate incoming harm.

## How much Stamina do my enemies have?
There are 3 classifications of foes, Minor, Major and Mythic. Minor foe only inflict 1 harm and take 3 harm, Major foes inflict 2 harm and take 2 harm while Mythic foes inflict 3 harm but only take 1 harm.

## What can I do during a clash?
There are 3 actions a Traveler might take during a Clash, Attack, Aid, or Defend.

## What do these actions do?

**Attacking**  
Attacking is an agressive action against foe and a successful attack inflicts harm. Failing the attack will result in you taking harm.

**Aiding**  
You can also aid your party in many ways, being a distraction, utilizing the environment in creative ways or using an item to aid in the clash. Aiding usually can only apply a +1 bonus to a single Travelers roll, but in some special cases the Guide might rule that the bonus applied to multiple Travelers. 

**Defending**  
Defending can stop incoming harm, creating an opening for another Traveler to attack without risk. An foe being defended against can only inflict harm on the defender and only if the defender fails their defense roll.

## What can the foe do during a clash?
A foe's actions are determined by the Travelers rolls, usually on a failed action against an foe the Traveler takes harm. Unless otherwise stated above.
