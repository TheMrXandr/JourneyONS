# Advanced Combat Module

## So, What Exactly is combat?
In Journey, combat is defined as an agressive encounter where one or more parties take violent action against another. Or put simply, when someone hits someone else. Some games can be played entirely without combat as a mechanic, but considering it's popularity in RPGs I felt it would be missed if Journey didn't offer some form of formal combat mechanics.

## So how does combat work?
Combat is meant to be quick while still offering a depth of strategy for your party. Conducted in quick coordinated efforts called "Clashes", the party has 60 seconds to decide together what they would like to do each clash and then all the Travelers roll at once. Failures and successes are determined and the scene is narrated by the Guide. If any advesaries are still standing another clash insues and this process repeats until either all the advesaries or all the Travelers have been incapacitated.

Take combat seriously in journey. You don't have much health and death is usually perminent.

## How much health do I have exactly?
Firstly Journey uses a metric called Stamina which represents your ability to push on. By default with the Combat module Travelers have 9 Stamina. However, some modules like Special Abilities or Equipment Management, might include features which add additional stamina or mitigate incoming damage.

## How much Stamina do my enemies have?
There are 3 classifications of enemies, minor, major and mythic. Minor enemies have only 3 Stamina, Major enemies have 6 while Mythic enemies have 9 Stamina.

## What can I do during a clash?
There are 3 types of actions a Traveler can take during combat. Attacking, Defending or Aiding. Each has it's own pros and cons and you'll have to decide for yourself what is right for your character in the moment.

**Attacking**  
Attacking is an agressive action against an advesary, and can comprise a light, medium, or heavy hit. Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages, for example: light hits are faster but do less damage while heavy hits are slow but cause significantly more damage.

- Light: +1 to roll. 1 Damage on success.
- Medium: 2 damage on success.
- Heavy: -1 to roll. 3 Damage on success.

Attacking an enemy who isn't being defended against leaves you open to recieving damage so coordinate attacks with your group.

**Defending**  
Defending can stop incoming damage, creating an opening for another Traveler to attack without risk. There are 3 types of defenses, a dodge, a parry and a block. Each are more effective against certain types of attacks. A success mitigates all damage from an incoming attack.

- Dodge. +1 to roll against Heavy attacks.
- Parry. +1 to roll against medium attacks.
- Block. +1 to roll against light attacks.

**Aiding**  
You can also aid your party in many ways, being a distraction, utilizing the environment in creative ways or using an item to aid in the clash. Aiding usually can only apply a +1 bonus to a single Travelers roll, but in some special cases the Guide might rule that the bonus applied to multiple Travelers.

## What can the enemy do during a clash?
Enemies have the same options as players, allowing for a diverse breadth of combat scenarios. Usually the Guide will decide what each enemy does however in the case that you are in a guideless game simply roll a d10 for each enemy.
- 0-3 - Attack
- 4-6 - Defend
- 7-9 - Aid

Guides never roll to determine outcomes for NPCs rather players roll against them. If the enemy attacks, and the player attacks, on a success both take damage on a failure neither take damage. If the NPC attacks but the player defends, on success the player takes no damage. If the NPC defends but the player attacks, 

attack > aid > defense > attack
