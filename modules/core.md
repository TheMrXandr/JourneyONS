## What Is This Game?

Journey is about creating a story either alone or with other Travelers. Sometimes you'll even have a Guide setting the scene and revealing the world to your group.

The rules will help your group tell their story and determine what happens along the way.

Once you have a character ready, you get to take control and decide what they do, then fate will decide how well it goes.

Journey can create short one session stories or epic tales that span through years of play. In the end though, there's no winning or losing, it was always about the Journey.

## What Do I Need To Know?

Journey is at it's best with 3 Travelers (players) and 1 Guide, but don't let that hold you back, Journey can be played with any combination of Travelers and Guides.

Each Traveler gets to create character that will act as one of the main characters in the story,while the Guide sets up the story and plays as the rest of the world, from NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to enemies and sometimes even the land itself. Their job is help the Travelers visualize and interact with the world. During Guideless play, Travelers will take turns describing and acting as the world around them.

Usually the it is the responsibility of the Guide to determine the cconsequences for the Travelers actions, however during Guidless play, the Traveler taking the action should imagine their own fate, though sometimes their fellow Travelers might offer suggestions and that's always great.

The Guide and the Travelers are always working together, collaborating on telling a unique strory, it should never feel like they are playing against each other.

## What Do We Need?

While Journey is always be played in person it was designed with distance in mind, and playing with friends accross the world is now a common thing.

Each Travelers should have a a few hours of free times, a way to roll a 10 sided die, and a way to communicate with the rest of the group. If you're planing on using any modules outside the core system, having a character sheet is also helpful for tracking any additional mechanics of the game.

## How Do We Play?

Journey, like most RPGs is about creating a story with your friends. So once the scene is set, you simply tell each other what your character is going to do and then roll to see the outcome.

It's really that simple. In Journey we use a 10 sided die numbered from 0-9, higher rolls are generally more positive outcomes while lower rolls tend to be more negative outcomes.

Once you roll if you are playing with a Guide it is their job to determine the outcome and then you get to describe to the group what it looked like.

Keep in mind that not every little action requires a roll.Generally you'll only roll when failing at an action would have a consequence.

**Example**
Guide:" The street is empty and the night is dark, you reach the door of the Pub where your friend told you to meet them but the door is locked. What do you do?"

Traveler: "I'd like to pick the lock!"

Guide: "Roll for it... That's a success! Tell us what happened!"

## What Do The Numbers On The Die Mean?

When taking an action in Journey you Roll a 10 sided die, commonly refered to as a d10. The Guide then determines the outcome. Of course during unguided play that responsibility falls onto the Traveler making the roll.

0. Failure with a Setback
1. Failure
2. Failure with a Twist
3. Failure
4. Failure with a Benefit
5. Success with a Setback
6. Success
7. Success with a Twist
8. Success
9. Success with a Benefit

## What Are Those Other Things?
Some outcomes have an additional flavor called Inclusions.

**Setbacks**
A setback is an additional occurrence determined by the Guide that hinders the Traveler or their Party's Progress in some way.

Example: When you pick the lock on that door you might also trip an alarm of some kind.

**Benefits**
A Benefit is an Inclusion determined by the Guide that aids the Traveler or their party in some small way.

*Example:* While picking the lock you might over hear some piece of vital information through the door.

**Twists**
A Twist is an inclusion that takes the story in a slightly different direction.

*Example:* While picking the lock you might notice blood pooling under the door.

## But What About Combat?!
Combat in the Core of Journey is very minimal, though if you want something more in depth take a look at the Advanced Combat Module (COMING SOON) found later in this book.

On a success your apponent is incapacitated. However, on a failure you are incapacitated.

If all Travelers are incompacitated the Guide will determine whether or not that means death based on the nature of the conflict.

## Is That it?

Yes, and no. This is everything you need to get started playing with your friends. However, there are more modules available to add more exciting mechanics to the gameplay.
