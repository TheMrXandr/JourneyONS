# Clashing

## So how does clashing work?
Combat in Journey is meant to be quick, brutal and dangerous, while still offering a depth of strategy for your party. Conducted in quick coordinated efforts called "Clashes", the party has 60 seconds to decide together what they would like to do each clash and then all the Travelers roll at once. Failures and successes are determined and the scene is narrated by the Guide. If any [Foes](foes.md) are still standing another clash ensues and this process repeats until either all the [Foes](foes.md) or all the Travelers have been incapacitated.



## What can I do during a clash?
There are 3 actions a Traveler might take during a Clash; Attacking, Defending, Aiding.

**Attacking**  
Attacking is an agressive action against [Foes](foes.md) and is made using a [Body](/wiki/character/assets/body.md) roll, a successful attack inflicts harm. Failing the attack will result in you taking harm unless the [Foes](foes.md) are successfully defended against by an ally.

**Defending**
Defending can stop incoming harm and is made using a [Body](/wiki/character/assets/body.md) roll, creating an opening for another Traveler to attack without risk. [Foes](foes.md) being defended against can only inflict harm on the defender and only if the defender fails their defense roll.

**Aiding**  
You can also aid your party in many ways, being a distraction, utilizing the environment in creative ways or using an item to aid in the clash. The roll for these actions depends on what you are trying to do and will be determined by your Guide.
