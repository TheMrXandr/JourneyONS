# Healing

## What is healing?
While [Resting](/wiki/downtime/resting.md) is the most reliable way to heal your character most Travelers have at the very least basic knowledge of first aid that can be used in a pinch. You usually won't heal for very much and there is always the risk that you might do more harm than good.

## When can I heal?
Healing can only be attempted once a day by each Traveler and can be used in combat as an aid action.

## How does healing work?
You'll roll [Soul](/wiki/character/assets/soul.md) to heal.

On a success(5-8) your healing is effective, heal 1 [Harm](/wiki/health/harm.md). On a (9) your healing was very effective heal 3 [Harm](/wiki/health/harm.md) or 1 injury.
On a failure(1-4) your healing is inneffective, heal no [Harm](/wiki/health/harm.md). On a (0) your healing was harmful, inflict 1 [Harm](/wiki/health/harm.md).
