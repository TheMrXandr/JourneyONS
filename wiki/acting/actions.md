## How do I play?

Journey, like most RPGs is about creating a story with your friends. So once the scene is set, you describe what your character does and the Guide will let you know whether or not a roll is required. Not every action requires a roll, you'll only need to roll when failure would have a consequence.

In Journey we use a 10 sided die numbered from 0-9 called a d10. Higher rolls are generally more positive outcomes while lower rolls tend to be more negative outcomes. *If your d10 is numbered from 1-10 then a roll of (10) would count as (0).*


**Example**  
Guide:" The street is empty and the night is dark, you reach the door of the Pub where your friend told you to meet them but the door is locked. What do you do?"

Traveler: "I'd like to pick the lock!"

Guide: "Roll for it... (7) That's a success! Tell us what happened!"

## What do the numbers on the die mean?

When taking an action in Journey you roll the die, add any bonuses to the roll and the Guide then determines the outcome.

0. Failure with a Setback
1. Failure
2. Failure with a Twist
3. Failure
4. Failure with a Benefit
5. Success with a Setback
6. Success
7. Success with a Twist
8. Success
9. Success with a Benefit

## What are those other things?
Some outcomes have an additional effect called Inclusions.

**Setbacks**  
A setback is an inclusion that hinders the Traveler or their Party's Progress in some way.

Example: When you pick the lock on that door you might also trip an alarm of some kind.

**Benefits**  
A Benefit is an Inclusion that aids the Traveler or their party in some small way.

*Example:* While picking the lock you might over hear some piece of vital information through the door.

**Twists**  
A Twist is an inclusion that takes the story in a slightly different direction.

*Example:* While picking the lock you might notice blood pooling under the door.

## Who decides what the Inclusion is?
The Guide will usually decide what the inclusion is based on the scenario but sometimes they may allow a player to trade 1 [Will](/wiki/capabilities/will.md) to insert their own inclusion instead.
