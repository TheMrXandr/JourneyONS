# Wealth
Wealth is a simplified math lite way of tracking a player's wealth as a whole and pricing items and services.

## How is Wealth tracked?
Wealth is tracked using tiers 0-9
0. Destitute
1. Poor
2. Livable
3. Comfortable
4. Fortunate
5. Significant
6. Opulent
7. Noble
8. Royal
9. Absurd

## How do I spend it?
Purchasing at a tier below your current Wealth costs you nothing.
Purchasing at your current Wealth Tier requires you to roll 1d10 against your wealth and on a failure, your Wealth decreases.

## How can I grow my wealth?
Finding or receiving significant wealth means you get to roll 1d10 against your wealth and if your roll is higher than your current Wealth Level, your Wealth goes up.
