# Trauma
Trauma comes in many forms and can cause an injury to any of your Assets, while each Asset can suffer up to 3 injuries.

## How does Trauma work in Journey?

Every 3rd harm suffered you must make a Trauma roll using the Asset suffering the [Harm](harm.md).

On a success (5-8) You suffer no injury. On a succes (9) You suffer no injury and heal 1 harm.
On a failure (1-4) You suffer an appropriate Minor Injury. On a failure (0) you suffer a Major Injury.

In the case the Trauma roll is triggered by suffering 3 harm at once, on faulure the Injuries become Major / Mythic respectively.

## What kinds of Injuries are there?
Depending on which Asset is injured your injury is going to be different.

For example; if you Injure your [Body](/wiki/character/assets/body.md) you might break a bone, but if you injur your [Mind](/wiki/assets/mind.md) you might suffer from shock, while injuring your [Soul](/wiki/character/assets/soul.md) might result in something like Depression.

## Are some injuries worse than others?
There are 3 tiers of Injury; Minor, Major, Mythic.

Minor injuries impose a -1 to all rolls made with that asset.
Major injuries impose a -2 to all rolls made with that asset.
Mythic injuries impose a -3 to all rolls made with that asset.

A Minor injury might look like a sprain and a major injury might be a bone fracture, while a mythic injury might mean losing a limb.

Mythic Injuries cannot be healed through normal means such as the [Healing](/wiki/capabilities/skills/healing.md) skill or [Rest](/wiki/downtime/resting.md)


## What happens when I have 3 injuries?
If you are suffering from 3 concurrent Injuries you are incapacitated until those injuries are [healed](/wiki/skills/healing.md) or embraced and become [handicap](handicap.md).
